# Starts a Redis server instance by loading configuration from a .env.redis file.
# If the port is already in use by another Redis server, it will stop the
# old instance before starting the new one (effectively restarting it).
#
# Usage:
#   ./config/start_redis.sh
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - redis-server, lsof, and ps must be installed and accessible in the PATH.
#   - A .env.redis file must exist in the project root.
